                                        Older homes can generally cost less than new homes, however, there are many cases
                                        where new homes can also cost less then older homes. Most new homes will not have
                                        any backyard landscaping and some don”t include any front landscaping either. With
                                        an older home, the landscaping is normally already completed and could have 10”s of
                                        thoUSnds of dollars in landscaping done, which is included in the purchase price.

                                        Taxes on some older homes may also be lower. Some people are charmed by the elegance
                                        of an older home but shy away because they”re concerned about potential maintenance
                                        costs. Consider a home warranty to get the peace of mind you deserve. A good Home
                                        Warranty plan protects you against unexpected repairs on many home systems and
                                        appliances for a full year or more after you move in.

                                        Builders have to follow very strict guidelines in new-homes and additions,
                                        especially in the West and Northwest, where earthquake safety standards must be
                                        observed. In general, new homes are usually more fire-safe and better accommodating
                                        of new security and garage-door systems.

                                        As you can see there are advantages and dis-advantages to each, but it really comes

                                        Most mortgages originated today calculate interest in arrears, unlike consumer loans
                                        which calculate interest to the date of payment receipt. As an example, when
                                        borrowers pay their February mortgage payments, they are paying the January
                                        interest. This method of calculating interest is based on a 360 day year in which
                                        each month has 30 days.
